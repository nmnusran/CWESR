LabVIEW VI for executing a continuous-wave ESR experiment with NI DAQmx data acquisition card and Rhode-n-Schwartz SMIQ signal gnerator
A pulse train from DAQ mx triggers the frequency stepping in the R-n-S. This is externally wired to be same as the same as Sample Clock.
Measurements: are set for counter mode to be read signal from single photon counter module (SPCM).

This VI was developed to perform ODMR spectral measurements from notrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.
